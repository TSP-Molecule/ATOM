# ATOM: A Tiny Object Modeler
TSP Spring 2018 project

Project SDK: Java 1.8

Element data from [andrejewski's periodic table](https://github.com/andrejewski/periodic-table) 

# Installation
To install, simply extract the contents of `ATOM-x.x.zip` into a folder and run the JAR. It does support double-clicking the JAR to run, but this is dependent on your OS settings. `$ java -jar ATOM.jar` will suffice.

# To run ATOM
Commandline compilation isn't currently functioning, but we've built a jar available in the repo, as well as provided one in our deliverables with the most up-to-date functional changes. 

So, the command to run is as follows:
`~$: java -jar ATOM.jar`

To use, simply click any GUI items available. The periodic table popup is available under `Navigation->View Periodic Table` in the menu bar.

# To use the search bar
   Click in the search bar and type the chemical name or formula you want to find.  Then click the button that reads "GO".  The search 
   may take a few seconds to display simple information in the right bottom panel.
